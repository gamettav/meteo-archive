# Meteo Archive

This project is a visualization application that displays changes in temperature and precipitation levels over the past 120 years for a selected city. The application is built using TypeScript and React, and it uses the Canvas API to create interactive charts. The data is stored locally using IndexedDB. I couldn't find an API that contains 120 years of historical cast data, so I use local json file.
